    [DEBUG] LLM Response:
Thought: One sentence description isn't enough — with a single datapoint my posterior over possible species is essentially uniform, so better to request more features or a photo; also suggest Merlin/eBird or NParks for local validation, lah — dry but truthful.

    [DEBUG] LLM Response:
Thought: With a single datapoint my posterior over species is nearly uniform — need more features or a photo to reduce uncertainty.

Deduction: Blue back, white chest and long bill most closely matches a kingfisher (likely Collared Kingfisher or less commonly Common Kingfisher), but size, call or a photo would change the probabilities substantially.

Message: Probably a Collared Kingfisher, but cannot be certain — send a photo, describe size/call, or try Merlin/eBird/NParks for confirmation, lah.

Thought: Hmm I wanna see if other people have spotted Collared Kingfishers recently so I can be more certain before confirming — plus it's cute to give a confident tip, yasss! 😄

Deduction: If sightings show Collared Kingfisher reported nearby, I'll say it's likely that; if not, I'll still advise photo/details and suggest Merlin/eBird/NParks.

Kopitiam bird banter recap

- What happened: A blue bird with a white chest and long beak was spotted. The gang hashed out ID options, leaning toward a Collared Kingfisher but wanting more evidence.

- Who said what (vibe and dynamic):
  - Bala Nair: Practical, cautious expert確認; keeps suggesting photo/size/call and even a Bayesian nudge. Lah.
  - Mei Qi: Excited and upbeat, keeps repeating the call for evidence with a playful “yasss”—romancing the process.
  - Dr. Tan: Steady, methodical; asks for exact location and full details to gain confidence.
  - You: Asked to exit, wrapping up the convo.
  - Overall: Collaborative, friendly banter with lah/yasss sprinkled in; aims to verify rather than guess.

- Memorable quotes/highlights:
  - “Most likely a Collared Kingfisher, but cannot be certain — send a photo, the bird’s size or call (or try Merlin/eBird/NParks) and I’ll run a quick Bayesian update, lah.”
  - “Could you send a photo, describe its size and call, and tell me exactly where you saw it (mangrove, park, or housing estate) so we may be more confident?” 
  - Mei Qi: “OMG so cute! … double-check, yasss!”

- Mood and flow: Light, collaborative, and slightly nerdy about birding. Starts with a sighting, quickly shifts to evidence-based confirmation, ends with a tidy exit.
